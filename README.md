# Student Grades Manipulation

## 1. Summary

I have created a vba application to help teachers and administrators manage student data. With the different modules I made you can choose an option that lists all the courses available and their course codes, I also created a module that lists out each student and their Id for a specific course that they are enrolled in. And finally, the last module I created helps you see the averages for different courses. I also created a function that deletes all the extra worksheets created. And lastly, I created a subroutine that packages all the data created into a report with all the student's final grades in a nicely organized histogram and a table with assignments and lab minimums, maximums, and averages. The report is in Microsoft word and is created in Excel.

## 2. Listing Courses

Upon opening of the excel sheets you are greeted with three buttons (image below). If you press the first one that is captions with "Visualize Student Data" a user form (image below) will pop up with three options. The first option lists all the courses available in the school. Simply check the box and press ok, then a new sheet will open displaying the courses. The next two button will be explained below.

## 3. Course Enrollment

The third button in my user form "Course Enrollment" will open another user form (image below) that has a dropdown menu which includes all the available courses, upon selection and pressing "OK" you will be shown a newly created worksheet that includes all the students that are currently enrolled into this class.

## 4. Course Averages

The second button in the "Menu" worksheet reads "Average Grades" upon pressing it will open a user form with a dropdown menu allowing you to choose a course and generating the class average for it.

## 5. Deleting Extra Worksheets

The third button in the "Menu" worksheets reads "Delete All Created Sheets" and upon pressing will delete all the newly generated worksheets.

## 6. Generate Report

Finally, the second option box inside the first user form allows you to generate a report including all the data generated throughout the different modules, that will package it all nicely with different graphs and descriptions.i
